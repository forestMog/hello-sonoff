Once apon a time I successfully translated a graphic childrens spelling game called Koalagrams from Pascal on Apple II to Forth to allow it to run on Commodore 64.  About a hundred-thousand mind bender lines of code. I have not fully recovered:  Since punyForth runs on the sonoff devices I hope to repair my mind.
